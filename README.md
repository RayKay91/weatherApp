# A simple weather app made with React.

Built using the API from [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/api). It responds to cities and countries, and if a status of 404 is given by the API it will show an error message.

Styling is done using [Materialize CSS](https://materializecss.com)

It is deployed on Netlify and you can view and test the app here: https://weather-checker-app.netlify.app

Something to improve upon would be the loading animation. At the moment the request happens so fast that the loading icon is only shown for a split second which can result in a non-smooth viewing experience when submitting the form.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
